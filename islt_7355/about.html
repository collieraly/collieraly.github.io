        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/headshot.png" alt="Alyssa Collier headshot" id="headshot">
        <p>I have a Master of Arts in Higher Education Administration and just started an Educational Specialist degree in Learning Technologies and Design through the University of Missouri. I expect to complete it in the spring of 2024. 
            Throughout my career, I’ve had a variety of roles in higher education. I have guided high school students through the admissions process. I have helped seniors develop resumes and write cover letters for their future jobs. I have even helped change a manikin into a new hospital gown before simulation training. 
        </p>
        <p>Now, I spend my days answering emails, calls and chat messages about technology. I currently work as an Instructional Technologist for Missouri Online. 
        </p> 
        <p>You can learn more about each of these roles on my experience page. Or you can check out  <a href="Collierresume.pdf">my full resume here </a> or view my video resume.
