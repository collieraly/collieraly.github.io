My name is Alyssa Collier and I’m a new student in the Ed.S. program in Learning Technology and Design. I live in Kansas City and work for Missouri Online as an Instructional Technologist, so if you have any problems with Canvas you can send them my way. I’ve helped manage websites in the past but have done my best to avoid the code and potentially screwing anything up. I’m expecting to get more comfortable with HTML and CSS through this course and to put those skills to use as I continue to work with code in Canvas and other tools. In my spare time, I can usually be found reading. If I don’t have a book in my hand, I’m likely listening to one while I garden or go for a long bike ride.
