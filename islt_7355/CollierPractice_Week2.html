     <!-- CODING BUDDIES COMMENT SECTION
        Hi all! I'm looking forward to coding with you this summer. I started a practice document this week so I thought I'd share that and open it up to your comments. 
        I feel like I'm already learning so much, but I'm afraid I'm going to have trouble keeping it straight as we keep building. 
        Has anyone had any big ah-ha moments with coding so far?-->
    <h1>Level 1 Heading</h1>
    <h2>Level 2 Heading</h2>

    <h4>Level 4 Heading</h4>
    <h5>Level 5 Heading</h5>
    <h6>Level 6 Heading</h6>
    <p>This is a test paragraph to help you identify how the paragraph tag works. The paragraph tag is one of the most used tags in a webpage containing text because it provides a container so you can modify the text to look the way you want.</p>
    <p>When you use the paragraph tag, it automatically places a space between the first paragraph and the next. The paragraph should be used for all text that is not formatted through other tags to keep all of your content the way you want it.</p>
    As Benjamin Franklin said:<blockquote>Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.</blockquote>
    <p><strong>Using only HTML, we can make this entire sentence bolded.</strong></p>
    <p>In this sentence, we only want the word <strong>bold</strong> to be <strong>bolded</strong>.</p>
    <p>With paragraphs, we can format text in a number of different ways. For instance, we can create paragraphs that are one large chunk of text, or we can break it into multiple smaller paragraphs. With paragraphs being one of the most used HTML elements, we have a lot of options to modify them to look the way we want. So, when we want to break a larger paragraph into smaller ones, we have some options.</p>
    <p>We can simply create two separate paragraph tag sets or we can simply place a line break element where we want the paragraphs to split. Either way will turn one paragraph into two, but the amount of space between them will be different. With two separate paragraph tag sets, you have a blank line between paragraphs but with a line break element, the second paragraph moves to the next line with no space between.</p>
