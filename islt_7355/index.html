            <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Alyssa Collier and I love thinking about how people learn. I enjoy analyzing what students are learning in the classroom, or in front of their computers, and how that’s going to help them in the real world. 
            In these pages, I’ll tell you more about myself, my education, and my future goals. Then, we’ll take a look back. I’ll share a little bit more about four of my previous roles working in higher education. You can learn more about each role and I’ll share a project or two that I worked on while there. Each of these jobs changed how I think about learning and helped shape my educational philosophy. Finally, you can read my full educational philosophy. I hope you’ll see why I believe in the power of experiences in learning and connecting the classroom to the real world. I’d love to talk with you more and you can reach out through the contact page.
