            <p id="firstparagraph">My career in higher education has shaped my views on education and learning. 
                Even as I was helping recruit high school students into college, I began to understand the power of the experiences that happened outside of the classroom. 
                It wasn’t going to be enough for them to show up on campus for four years. 
                Instead, they would need to get involved. 
                They would need to try out new things, get out of their comfort zone, and take their learning beyond the lectures. 
                I really enjoyed having those conversations with juniors and seniors in high school and sharing stories about what current students were doing. 
                Sometimes, I could see the moment when prospective students started envisioning themselves on campus having their own learning experiences. 
                </p> 
            <p>Working in Career Services gave me a different perspective on these experiences. 
                It was always difficult to help a student create their resume when they didn’t have much experience to add. 
                In those cases, I often asked about what they learned in class or what projects they’d worked on. 
                Some could answer, but many couldn’t come up with anything meaningful. 
                This reiterated to me the importance of having high-impact experiences. 
                It also showed the value of helping students understand the value of what they were learning in the classroom and how it would relate to the real world. 
                </p>
            <p>Seeing the value of getting students out of the classroom, I then made a move to working in healthcare simulation. 
                This was a great opportunity to see short learning experiences at work, instead of a semester-long internship. 
                It was amazing to see how much students learned in just two hours. 
                They were using what they had learned in the classroom and had to put it to work on a simulated patient. 
                And, they had the benefit of a reset button if anything went wrong. 
                While I saw how much students grew during these experiences, I also saw the high cost. 
                Our team put in a ton of work and planning on the back end, not to mention the cost of equipment and maintaining the space. 
                These highly valuable experiences couldn’t be available to everyone and didn’t translate to many other professional fields. 
                </p> 
            <p>My current role is focused on doing education well for everyone. 
                While I do spend most of my time making sure the technology is working, that’s because I want to make sure everyone has an equal opportunity to learn. 
                I also enjoy training others to use technology and brainstorming with them to put it to use for their students. 
                I also have the opportunity to weigh in on the new technologies we are considering across campus and help with the training and implementation for our faculty. 
                I get to be part of making sure they have the tools they need to teach students in new and exciting ways. 
                </p> 
            <p>Now, I’m continuing my education so I can focus on measuring and tracking learning. 
                I don’t believe it’s enough to say that you are teaching well or that students enjoy your course. 
                I think you must be able to prove that your teaching methods are working. 
                I want to help instructors think through their learning objectives. 
                Then, I want to brainstorm how their students are going to achieve those objectives and what technology might help them along the way. 
                And, at the end of every semester, I want students to have portfolios full of new artifacts that they can take to potential employers. 
                I want them to be able to articulate what they learned in each class and how they’re going to bring those skills into the role. 
                I don’t believe education should be about jumping through hoops, checking boxes, or walking away with a degree. 
                I truly believe that it is about the process of learning. 
                And I want to make sure that every single student has meaningful experiences that impact their learning, not just for a semester, but for their life.
